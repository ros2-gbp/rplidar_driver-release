> **"Because the official driver shouldn't crash just because you pulled the plug."**

A **fault-tolerant** ROS 2 driver for Slamtec RPLIDAR, built around a
**Lifecycle State Machine** and a **thread-safe architecture**. Your robot
keeps running even under hardware disconnection or permission failures.

## ⚡ Why Use This?

Most existing RPLIDAR drivers assume the hardware never misbehaves. This
driver assumes the opposite. Compared to the reference implementation:

| Capability | Reference Driver | **This Driver** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Hot-plug recovery** | Not handled | ✅ Auto-reconnect via lifecycle FSM |
| **Permission failure reporting** | Silent failure | ✅ Explicit diagnostics |
| **Runtime reconfiguration** | Restart required | ✅ Live RPM / scan-mode update |
| **Component composition** | Standalone only | ✅ `rclcpp_components` support |
| **SDK coupling** | Direct calls throughout | ✅ Interface-based abstraction layer |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option A — Binary install *(coming soon)*

This package has been submitted to the ROS 2 build farm. Once it syncs, you
will be able to install it directly:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rplidar-driver
```

Supported distros: **Humble**, **Jazzy**, **Lyrical**, and **Rolling**.

### Option B — Build from source

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/frozenreboot/rplidar_driver.git
cd ..

# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

# Build the workspace
colcon build --symlink-install
```

### Quick Launch

```bash
ros2 launch rplidar_driver rplidar.launch.py serial_port:=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Dynamic Reconfigure (Runtime)

You can change the motor speed without killing the node:

```bash
ros2 param set /rplidar_node rpm 1000
ros2 param set /rplidar_node scan_mode DenseBoost
```

## 🧪 Call for Experiments: "Does it survive?"

We need your help to validate this driver on various robots!
If you use this driver, please **stress-test** it (e.g., unplug USB while
scanning, change RPM dynamically) and share your results.

### 📢 How to Submit a Report
Please open an issue with the title `[Experiment] Your_Robot_Name` and include:
1. **Lidar Model:** (e.g., A1, A2, S1...)
2. **Recovery Log:** (Copy paste the terminal output when you unplug/replug)
3. **Screenshot:** `rqt_graph` or `rviz2`

## 🏗️ Architecture

This driver uses a **3-Layer Design** to decouple ROS 2 logic from the vendor SDK.

- **Node Layer:** Handles Lifecycle & Parameters.
- **Wrapper Layer:** Handles Threading & Mutex.
- **SDK Layer:** Raw data fetching.
