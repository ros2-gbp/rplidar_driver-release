@file   rplidar.launch.py
@brief  Launch file for the Slamtec RPLIDAR ROS 2 Lifecycle node.

This launch description:
  - Declares configurable launch arguments (params file, RPM, scan mode, etc.)
  - Starts the Lifecycle-based RPLIDAR node
  - Automatically drives the node through CONFIGURE -> ACTIVATE transitions

The node itself is implemented in `rplidar_node` and uses a managed lifecycle:
  - On startup the process is launched
  - Once the process is up, a CONFIGURE transition is emitted
  - When the node reaches the `inactive` state, an ACTIVATE transition is emitted
